---
LoroCam always shows you a sound meter bar which what you can easily calibrate the volume of
the sound effects.<br/>
You only have to push the sound buttons and watch the sound meter bar doesn't turn red so often.<br/>
To adjust the volume only turn it up or down on the volume slide bar.<br/>
Make a few videos and listen to them before recording your final, thats the best thing you can do.<br/>
