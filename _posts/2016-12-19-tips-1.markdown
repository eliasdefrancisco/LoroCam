Adding sounds to your videos never was so easy, you only have to start recording and
press the button of the sound you want to play.<br/>
Many sounds can be played at time, then you can combine some sounds as easy as pressing some buttons quickly.<br/>
A great combination in example are pressing the clap button many times and mixing with laughs.<br/>
